oops concepts:class,object
class :
It is specified as a blueprint that describe the behaviors/states for an object.
Its is user defined datatype.
class consist of data members and members function, which can be accessed depending on the access specifier.the object of the class hold separate copies of data members. 
Its is possible to create as many objects of a class  as required.
syntax:
class className{
    access modifier:
    data member;
    access modifier:
    member function(){
        body of function.
    }
};
Object:                                                             
An Object can be defined as an entity that has a state and behavior, or in other words, anything that exists physically in the world is called an object. It can represent a dog, a person, a table, etc. An object means a combination of data and programs, which further represent an entity.
syntax: 
className object _name;


In this we can protect our data by using access specifier/modifier.

3 types they are:-
1.public: you can used public data any where in the program.
2.private: you can't the data directly in other class or function for that you need get and set function to use it
3.protected :it can be used in the child class only.
