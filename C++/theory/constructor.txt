Constructor:
It is a special member function of a class which is executed whenever we create new objects of that class.it contains exact same name as the class and it does not have any return type.

Features of constructor:
1. a constructor is called immediately after object creation.
2. it has same name as class name.
3. it does not return any value.
4. a constructor is called only once during the lifetime of an object.

Use of it:
it is use to initialize data member of an object with user-defined values in place of default values.

Types of constructor:
1.Default constructor
2.Parameterized constructor
3.Copy constructor

Constructor overloaded:
Overloaded constructors will have the same name(name of class),but different number of arguments/parameter.

Destructor:
A destructor works opposite to a constructor.
It is executed whenever an object of its class goes out of scope. 
When we create an object , a particular memory is allocated to it .
If we not destroy that object ,the memory will remain occupied by the unused object.
Destructor performs this task by releasing the memory occupied by an unset object.
Destructor name should be exactly the same as the name of the class ,but it is precede by the tiled sign(~).
Destructor doesn't have any return type.
It does not take any parameter.
Destructor cannot be overloaded.
It frees the memory of an object whenever it goes out of scope.
