difference between structure and union:


Structure:-	
To define a structure,we use "struct" keyword	.
Every member has their own memory place	.
A change in one data member’s value has an impact on the value of other data members.
The overall size of a structure is the sum of all the sizes of all data members.

Union:-
To define a union ,we use "union" keyword.
Memory location is shared by all data members.
A change in the value of one data member has no effect on the structure’s other data members.
The biggest data member determines the total size of a union.
